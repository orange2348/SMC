<body>
  <p>
    The module contains an example Java application which
    implements the TCP state machine on top of a UDP socket. This
    implementation represents TCP only at its most fundamental,
    not attempting to capture the more sophisticated TCP aspects.
  </p>
  <p>
    The TCP state machine is defined in {@code TcpConnection.sm}
    and the SMC plug-in is used to generate the source file
    {@code TcpConnectionContext.java}. Once built, the
    application can be run in either server mode or client mode.
    In server mode, the command line is:
  </p>
  <pre><code>$ java -classpath ... smc_ex6.server &lt;port&gt;</code></pre>
  where &lt;port&gt; is the server TCP port.
  <p>
    The client command line is similar:
  </p>
  <pre><code>$ java -classpath ... smc_ex6.client &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;</code></pre>
  where &lt;host&gt; is either a host name or dotted IP address
  and &lt;port;&gt; is the server TCP port opened on that host.
