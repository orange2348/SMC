<body>
  <p>
    This package contains the SMC Maven mojo {@link SmcMojo}. The
    SMC mojo supports the same options as the SMC command line.
  </p>
  <p>
    This mojo can be used to compile a .sm file into any one of
    the supported target languages but most likely will be used
    for Java, either as java or java7.
